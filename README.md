Portfolio For Coding at SNHU
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address? The goal was to create an application for students at a university in regards to class registration. We needed to allow students to pick classes from a user interface and register as well as have error prompts if a student registered for the same class twice or too many credit hours.

What did you do particularly well in developing this application? I made sure the user interface was easy to use as well as having the appropriate errors pop up when the user encountered them. I also made sure the class list was easy to navigate and button placement was easy to find in the interface.

Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? The WPF was easier to layout as you have a graphic user interface upfront as far as button placement as the console would need to be strictly lines of code to produce the same outcome. I kept the user in mind by having large enough buttons and the placement was key for ease of use. Having things spread apart was useful in making sure there were no overlaps in placement as well.

How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
I would make the necessary changes step by step using the laid out instructions and then debug to see if it worked. For example, I would add the popup for the user having added the class registry twice and make sure that worked before moving on to code and debug the next item.

Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process? I made sure I placed the button in a different spot on the right hand side of the user interface as it felt more natural than the examples we were given. I also chose to have error prompts for all messages as this didnâ€™t give the user an option to not read it as they had to click out of the error. This made for an easier experience for the user.
